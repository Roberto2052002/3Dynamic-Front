PROMPT FOR REPLIT (FRONT-END ONLY — DO NOT CONNECT ANY BACKEND OR DB)

Build a single-page React + Tailwind landing site for a physiotherapy clinic. Do not use Next.js. Front-end only: no database, no network requests, no Replit DB, and no backend stubs—form submit should just console.log and show a local success message.
The page uses smooth scroll anchors and a sticky top bar. Include a floating sticky CTA button (bottom-right) that scrolls to the form.

Design & Colors

The background color across the whole site should be a modern grey (use Tailwind’s neutral/stone/zinc scale).

Replit must auto-select all accent colors (buttons, highlights, glows, links, icons) so the site looks modern, clean, and professional.

Accent colors must contrast well with the grey background for readability and accessibility.

Avoid neon or overly playful palettes; keep it medical/athletic and professional.

Global requirements

Mobile-first, responsive, accessible; semantic landmarks; proper headings; alt text; focus styles; skip-to-content link.

Sticky Top Bar with three zones:

Left: Hamburger button that opens a slide-in sidebar (from left). Sidebar contains the logo at top and a list of anchor links to each section (clicking scrolls and closes the drawer).

Center: Logo.

Right: Phone number (tap-to-call link) and a language switch (EN/ES) that toggles the entire UI text.

Smooth scroll; anchor IDs: #home, #products, #reviews, #staff, #about, #contact.

Keep CLS low; lazy-load media; use poster for video; defer non-critical scripts.

Clean, modern medical/athletic look with subtle scroll reveals, rounded cards, soft shadows.

Floating CTA: sticky button at bottom-right that scrolls to #contact; visible on all sections; accessible label.

Front-end only reminder: No API keys, no fetch/axios, no server calls, no Replit DB. Everything is in-memory.

Top Bar & Sidebar details

Top bar stays sticky at top with slight blur/background for readability.

Hamburger → Sidebar (modal drawer):

Drawer contains: clinic logo, and nav links: Home, Products, Reviews, Staff, About, Contact.

Clicking a link closes the drawer and smoothly scrolls to the section.

Drawer must be keyboard navigable, trap focus when open, and close with ESC / overlay click.

Right zone: Phone number as tel: link, plus an EN/ES toggle (switch UI). Use an in-memory dictionary for all labels (nav, headings, buttons, form fields, placeholders, schedule labels, etc.). No external i18n libs required (simple context or hook is fine).

Section order and specs (exactly in this order):

HERO (id="home")

Full-width background video (muted, autoplay, loop, playsinline) with dark overlay.

Over the video: headline, short subhead, primary CTA button that scrolls to #contact.

Provide a poster fallback for performance; ensure text contrast and readability.

PRODUCTS (id="products")

Three cards: Therapy, Recovery, Recovery Room.

Each card: image placeholder, short description, and prominent circular “price bubbles” (pill/badge style) with example prices (e.g., “$99 / session”). Bubbles must be visually distinct and responsive.

Each card includes a secondary action (e.g., “Learn more”) that scrolls to #contact.

REVIEWS (id="reviews")

A continuously auto-scrolling horizontal carousel that moves to the right and loops infinitely.

Each review shows: star rating, short text (1–2 lines), reviewer name/initials.

Must:

Auto-scroll horizontally, pause on hover/focus, swipeable on touch.

Smooth performant animation; no heavy carousel libraries.

Include 8–12 placeholder reviews in EN/ES (translates via language toggle).

STAFF (id="staff")

Exactly two staff profiles; stacked on mobile, side-by-side on desktop.

Each: photo, name, credentials, 1–2 sentence bio.

Subtle hover effect and focus outline.

ABOUT (id="about")

Embedded Google Map (iframe) with placeholder.

Below: address, phone, and email with icons.

Weekly schedule (Mon–Sun) with placeholder hours.

All labels/days must toggle between EN/ES.

CONTACT FORM (id="contact")

Fields: Full Name (required), Email (required/valid), Phone (required).

Concern toggle: two side-by-side buttons “Injury” and “Pain” that glow when selected.

Large textarea: “What’s happening?” (required).

Checkbox (required): “I agree to be contacted.”

Submit button disabled until form is valid.

On submit: console.log payload + show inline success message.

All labels, placeholders, messages must translate EN/ES.

Interactions & polish

Scroll-reveal animations for section headings/cards.

Nav links highlight when their section is in view.

Account for sticky top bar so content isn’t hidden.

Floating CTA always visible with tooltip and accessible label.

SEO & metadata

Basic SEO tags (title/description, social share image placeholder).

Include a commented JSON-LD LocalBusiness block with TODOs (name, logo, phone, address, openingHours).

Deliverables

A single React page/component with all sections in this order: Hero → Products → Reviews → Staff → About → Contact.

Sticky top bar and sticky bottom-right CTA.

Tailwind for styling with modern grey background + Replit-chosen accent colors that look professional.

No DB, no backend, no external i18n libs, minimal dependencies.
